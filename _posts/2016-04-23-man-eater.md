# Man Eater

I used to be a man eater

That was my name

You know the lyrics

I took pride in it

I wanted everyone

To look at me, me

I made them work hard

I dangled the carrot

Some probably wish

They never met me at all

Some may be still 

Picking up their testicles

Well that was me

I was known for it

For pulling them in 

And spitting them out

Some could see through

That underneath it all

I was too scared of love

That I had closed those doors

Yet I miss that part of me

That walked with passion

Talked with passion

And knew what I wanted

I always knew I could get it

With games of seduction

But that was it

A game played

I was the loser

No I was the learner

I see differently now

I can see another way

I wish for that confidence

That self-assuredness

That clarity

To get what I want

I promise this time I'll use it for good

That I'll bring out the best

Rather than overpower

Or diminish

Come back to me

From the shadows

Of repressed memories

We are friends you and I

Man eater

Man lover

Man hater

Man opener
